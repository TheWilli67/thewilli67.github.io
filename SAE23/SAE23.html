            Introduction

        <p class="portfolio_text">
            This topic will allow you to provide an interface for managing a game library. Users will be able to
            comment
            games and
            add them to their personal list. The data schema is the following
            <li class="portfolio_text">game categories (id, name, description)</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">games (id, title, year of release, box picture, publisher, author, category)
            </li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">authors (id, name, first name, age, photos)</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">players (id, name, email, password, type => professional or private)</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">comments on the games (games, players, note, comment, date)</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">a list of games for users</li>
        <p class="portfolio_text">
            You must implement a CRUD for each of these data types. You will prepare the database in advance and
            fill it
            with
            categories, games and authors.
            Your website should allow for the input of new users and the comments they make on the games. You will
            calculate for
            each game the average score for each type of commenter. you will also have to highlight the comments
            with
            the highest
            and lowest score on each game page.

            You should also be able to insert new games with a file. If the author does not exist, it will be
            created
            with the name
            and surname. The structure of the expected file should of course be described either in a help or in the
            preamble of the
            loading page.

            You should be able to generate a file for a player, with his list of games and the comments he made on
            each
            game and the
            average score of the game.

            This project was quite complicated in its realization, we had to train and learn how to integrate and
            manage
            a database
            in the Django Framework, the consequent work that was asked of us was nevertheless realized by counting
            the
            fact that we
            were only two while the other groups were groups of three. My colleague did the Django and the database
            integration
            while I took care of the CSS, the virtual machine and the Gantt planning. But despite the limited time
            we
            managed to
            finish our project on time with only one missing feature the site is 100% functional and on a VM when
            bridged it works
            like a site hosted on an external server.
            <br><br>
            Resources used to make our project:
            <li class="portfolio_text">Django Framework</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">Python</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">HTML 5</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">CSS 4</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">MySQL</li>
            <li class="portfolio_text">VM-Ware/VirtualBox</li>
        <p class="portfolio_text">
            In conclusion :
            This project was quite interesting in the content, in the form it was nevertheless quite chaotic, a lack
            of
            time quite
            important. But I find that this type of project allows us to grow, to be able to confront our ideas and
            ideals, and to
            be in stressful working conditions that I find quite interesting to analyze afterwards
